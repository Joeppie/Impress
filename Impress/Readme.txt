This text editor is designed to allow you to format minecraft books outside minecraft itself and repeatedly print them.

How to use:

Editing:
Write or copy text into the leftmost textbox, the rightmost textview will display the output as it would appear in Minecraft.
As the amount of text exceeds what fits onto one page, the navigation buttons to the right will become enabled.

You can employ '&' followed by the numbers 0-9 or a-f for colours, and may also use other formatting codes.
To see which formatting codes can be used, take alook at the autoformat wizard.

The Autoformat wizard allows you to quickly apply several formatting options which improve the looks of the book.

Naturally, you may want so save and later load the book, this can be done through use of the file menu.

Printing:
When you are satisifed with your book and wish to print it to minecraft, press the "Print" button.

A seperate form will pop up, which can stay on top. Every time you press the "Copy page" button,
the next page of the book will be copied to your clipboard.
Since the form stays on top, you can repeatedly paste (ctrl-v) the contents of one page into the minecraft book, advance that one page and then repeat.

(Should something go wrong when pasting, review the 'preview' in the printing form and check which page went wrong.)

Troubleshooting:

I tried to print a page but nothing happened!
-This occurs when minecraft cannot fit the text being pasted onto one page.
The cause will inevitably be that Impress cannot exactly predict what text will fit onto one page, So try removing one line from the bottom (put it on the next page)
and see where an unexpected linebreak occurs in minecraft, then reduce the amount of text on said page and preferably report the issue with a  saved book.txt to Joeppie :)

I am trying to enter text, but from the bottom of the page, characters are disappearing?
Minecraft only allows up to 255 characters on a single page. This includes formatting codes.
The best solution is to remove all redundant formatting and end the page by using enters until you reach a new page.
